PHP-OOP-Concept:
Object-oriented programming is a programming model organized around Object
rather than the actions and data rather than logic.

Class: class is an entity or a blueprint that determines how an object
will behave and what the object will contain

object: An object ia an instance of a class 

Constructor: A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function 
when you create an object from a class.

PHP - The __destruct Function
A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

If you create a __destruct() function, PHP will automatically call this function at the end of the script.
